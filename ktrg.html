	<h1>knit tech reading group</h1>
	<div class="text-content">

		<p>The Knit Tech Reading Group (KTRG) meets monthly to discuss contemporary research in knitting technology. The aim of the group is to convene practitioners and researchers from a diverse range of backgrounds to further discussion of the following questions:
			<ul>
				<li>what are the idiosyncrasies of knit as a medium? why is knitting <i>like that</i>?</li>
				<li>when designing tools for the creation of knit textiles, what kinds of task and operation have been under-considered?</li>
				<li>how do we evaluate the <i>quality</i> (in terms of craftsmanship, design, ease of use) of new advances in knit technology?</li>
				<li>how can software tools (made using code) work with and for experienced knitters? how can or should they work for people with no knit experience?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			We convene an open reading group at 4pm GMT, on the first Wednesday of every month. Each month, we will pre-read and then discuss two readings (normally research papers), both relating to a particular theme within knitting and technology. A document of past and future readings is available here. You can sign up to the mailing list <a href="https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/knit-tech">here</a>.
